ROADMAP

WISHLIST
0.02	TST anyevent example
0.03 	TST push-down parser example (JSON?)
0.03	TST some benchmarks
0.03	API event filter - preprocess ALL events before sending to handlers
0.03	TST ad-hoc parser example (aka ini file)
0.03	DEV state graph object, stringify
0.03	DEV per machine stats (now many in which state) (do we need it? )
0.03	API state redefine properties w/o changing sub
0.03	DOC More rationale & basic SM discussion (?)
0.03	API Make Instance methods (CONTRACT) more consistent.
		Like no new() params, but both set_state and set_schema present.
0.03	API Event preprocessor callback
0.03	API Define accepting states. Accepting = if stopped here, input's fine.
0.03	API	Add is_final to state.
0.03	TST Add distributed connected machines example.
0.03	TST Add improved PSGI example to show inheritance power.

DISCUSSION
0.02	Extract FSM::Arrow::Schema?
0.03	Extract State object? (Will kill perf)
0.03	Short-circuit transitions? 
		(i.e. next state gets the same event immediately)
0.03	All-state transitions? (e.g. disconnect on a phone call)
0.03	Chained handlers? (i.e. handler1 returned nothing => check 2 & so on)

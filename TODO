ROADMAP (future version, change required for that version)

WISHLIST (past version, change that was suggested during that version)
* UP NEXT
0.04	TST Expect example (run external program, control execution flow,
		enter passwd)
0.07	API Add FSM::Arrow::AE::Handle - base class/trait for async IO
0.07	DEV Debugging primitives for showing "stack trace":
		event(type, ...); machine (schema, state, ...); stack of all machines
		in use at given moment
0.07	API State machine instance id (sm_id?)
0.07	API State machine instance and event to_string & "" overload

* MODULES HIGH
0.03	API state redefine properties w/o changing sub ( keep => 1 )
0.03	DOC More rationale & basic SM discussion (?)
0.05	API sm_transition locking (like states) & uniqueness check
0.06	DOC explain reenterability
0.06	API strict vs inheritance -rule out
0.06	API sm_transition_from (name?) - add transition to non-current state
0.06	API stateless events - don't depend on state, don't trigger state change
0.07	API Determine if there are more events to come (sm_pending? has_queue?)
0.07	API Don't rethrow after on_error

* MODULES LOW
0.03	DEV test_contract( $class ) - check that $class is ready for SM usage
0.03	DEV per machine stats (now many in which state) (do we need it? )
0.03	DEV state graph object, stringify
0.05	API FSM::Arrow::Builder - construct machine state-by-state.
0.06	API ret val available in cb (local $FSM::Arrow::ret?)
0.06	API rename Instance methods (handle_event, is_final, accepting) to sm_*
0.06	DEV Add typed transitions to pretty-print
0.07	API sm_init engine => [ Moose|Class::StateMachine|fields|none|auto ]
0.07	API Short circuit transitions ( via unshift sm_queue ) (sm_prepend?)
0.07	API queueless fast handle?

* EXAMPLES
0.03	TST ad-hoc parser example (aka ini file)
0.03 	TST push-down parser example (JSON?)
0.03	TST Add distributed connected machines example.
0.03	TST Add improved PSGI example to show inheritance power.
0.04	TST nested machine example - low-level machine assembling events
		for high-level one
0.04	TST inherited machine example

* MISC
0.06	DOC More concrete README.md

DISCUSSION ITEMS
0.02	Extract FSM::Arrow::Schema?
0.03	Extract State object? (Will kill perf)
0.03	All-state transitions? (e.g. disconnect on a phone call)
0.03	Chained handlers? (i.e. handler1 returned nothing => check 2 & so on)
0.03	Deferred events (cannot handle right now, but will be able to later)
		Return special value? Implement queue in Instance? Leave to implementor?

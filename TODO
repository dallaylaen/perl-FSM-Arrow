ROADMAP (future version, change required for that version)

WISHLIST (past version, change that was suggested during that version)
0.02	TST anyevent example
0.03 	TST push-down parser example (JSON?)
0.03	TST ad-hoc parser example (aka ini file)
0.03	DOC More rationale & basic SM discussion (?)
0.03	API Define accepting states. Accepting = if stopped here, input's fine.
0.03	API	Add is_final() to Instance.
0.03	TST Add improved PSGI example to show inheritance power.
0.04	TST Expect example (run external program, control execution flow,
		enter passwd)
0.04	API Add typed events + strict transitions
		transition: event_type => new_state => code

FAR WISHLIST (past version, change that was suggested during that version)
0.03	DEV state graph object, stringify
0.03	DEV per machine stats (now many in which state) (do we need it? )
0.03	API state redefine properties w/o changing sub
0.03	TST Add distributed connected machines example.
0.03	DEV test_contract( $class ) - check that $class is ready for SM usage
0.03	API Event preprocessor callback
0.03	API Make Instance methods (CONTRACT) more consistent.
		Like no new() params, but both set_state and set_schema present.
0.04	API stricture - require ALL states to have next => [...]
0.04	API next=>[] means final
0.04	TST nested machine example - low-level machine assembling events
		for high-level one
0.04	TST inherited machine example

DISCUSSION ITEMS
0.02	Extract FSM::Arrow::Schema?
0.03	Extract State object? (Will kill perf)
0.03	Short-circuit transitions? 
		(i.e. next state gets the same event immediately)
0.03	All-state transitions? (e.g. disconnect on a phone call)
0.03	Chained handlers? (i.e. handler1 returned nothing => check 2 & so on)
0.03	Deferred events (cannot handle right now, but will be able to later)
		Return special value? Implement queue in Instance? Leave to implementor?

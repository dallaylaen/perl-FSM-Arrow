ROADMAP (future version, change required for that version)
0.04	TST parser, web, and anyevent examples

WISHLIST (past version, change that was suggested during that version)
0.02	TST anyevent example
0.03 	TST push-down parser example (JSON?)
0.03	API event filter - preprocess ALL events before sending to handlers
0.03	TST ad-hoc parser example (aka ini file)
0.03	DOC More rationale & basic SM discussion (?)
0.03	API Make Instance methods (CONTRACT) more consistent.
		Like no new() params, but both set_state and set_schema present.
0.03	API Event preprocessor callback
0.03	API Define accepting states. Accepting = if stopped here, input's fine.
0.03	API	Add is_final to state.
0.03	TST Add improved PSGI example to show inheritance power.

FAR WISHLIST (past version, change that was suggested during that version)
0.03	DEV state graph object, stringify
0.03	DEV per machine stats (now many in which state) (do we need it? )
0.03	API state redefine properties w/o changing sub
0.03	TST Add distributed connected machines example.
0.03	DEV test_contract( $class ) - check that $class is ready for SM usage

DISCUSSION ITEMS
0.02	Extract FSM::Arrow::Schema?
0.03	Extract State object? (Will kill perf)
0.03	Short-circuit transitions? 
		(i.e. next state gets the same event immediately)
0.03	All-state transitions? (e.g. disconnect on a phone call)
0.03	Chained handlers? (i.e. handler1 returned nothing => check 2 & so on)
0.03	Deferred events (cannot handle right now, but will be able to later)
		Return special value? Implement queue in Instance? Leave to implementor?
